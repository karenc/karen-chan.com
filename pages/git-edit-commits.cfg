h1 = Watch how to edit commits in Git
content =
    <p>At the beginning of this video, I have some uncommitted changes.  They include some new features and some fixes for previous commits.</p>
    <p>I have a fix for the turnover_declarations_helper.rb and I decided to rewrite initTurnoverUnitAndPeriodSelects in turnover_declaration.js to be a function.</p>
    <p>First, I run "git add -p app/helpers/turnover_declarations_helper.rb" to pick the bits for fixing previous commits and commit it.</p>
    <p>Then, I run "git add -p public/javascripts/controllers/turnover_declarations.js" to pick the bits for fixing previous commits and commit it.  (You can commit them in one commit as well, since they both fixes the same commit)</p>
    <p>After that, I run "git rebase -i qa" to reorder the commits, then mark my fix commits as "fixup"s.</p>
    <p>In case you rebase and then realize it is not what you want, have a look at "git reflog", it has the commit from before you start the rebase.  You can look at the commits using "git log db7f236" and do "git reset --hard db7f236" to get back to the point before you rebase.</p>
